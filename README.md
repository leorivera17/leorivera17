# Hey, I'm Leo.


### I am excited to introduce myself and share some of the coursework and projects I have worked on.

## Coursework
Throughout my academic journey, I have undertaken a diverse range of coursework, which has provided me with a strong foundation in various fields of computer science. Some of the key coursework I have completed includes:

***Digital Design***: This course explores number systems, Boolean algebra, Boolean functions, function minimization, analysis and design of combinational and sequential digital logic circuits, and introduces Hardware Description Language (HDL) concepts for digital design and synthesis in Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).

***Computer Design and Assembly Language Programming***: This course focuses on the design and implementation of digital computer circuits using CAD tools for programmable logic devices (PLDs), covering basic computer design, including datapath components and control units, as well as an introduction to assembly language programming for off-the-shelf RISC-based microcontrollers.

***Introduction to Computing***: This course covers the basics of algorithmic problem solving, programming principles, control structures, data types, input/output operations, software development process, and the syntax of modern programming languages.

***Fundamentals of Computer Science***: This course provides hands-on experience using a supportive software development environment to design, develop, and test applications in a selected domain, showcasing the potential of computing careers and introducing key concepts in computing.

***Data Structures***: This course introduces data structures and algorithms, covering abstract datatypes, advanced data structure implementation, theoretical and empirical analysis of recursive and iterative algorithms, as well as software performance evaluation and testing techniques.

***Project-Based Object-Oriented Programming and Design***: This course focused on object-oriented programming and design with applications to project construction. Introduction to class design, interfaces, inheritance, generics, exceptions, streams, and testing. 

***Discrete Structures***: This course covers the fundamental structures of computer science, including logic, sets, relations, functions, graphs, and trees, as well as propositional and predicate logic. It explores the applications of predicate logic to preconditions, postconditions, proof techniques, and examines the complexity of algorithms.
