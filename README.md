# Hey, I'm Leo.


### I am excited to introduce myself and share some of the coursework and projects I have worked on.

## Coursework
Throughout my academic journey, I have undertaken a diverse range of coursework, which has provided me with a strong foundation in various fields of computer science. Some of the key coursework I have completed includes:

***Digital Design***: I have gained a deep understanding of digital logic circuits and their design principles, enabling me to develop efficient and optimized digital systems.

***Computer Design and Assembly Language Programming***: I have learned about computer architecture and the low-level programming language, Assembly. This coursework has given me insights into how computers work at the hardware level and how to write efficient programs.

***Introduction to Computing***: This coursework provided me with a broad overview of the fundamentals of computing, including topics such as computer organization, operating systems, and networks.

***Fundamentals of Computer Science***: I have studied the core concepts of computer science, including algorithms, complexity analysis, and problem-solving techniques.

***Data Structures***: I have delved into various data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, and learned how to implement and utilize them efficiently.

***Project-Based Object-Oriented Programming and Design***: This coursework focused on object-oriented programming principles and design patterns, equipping me with the skills to develop modular and maintainable software.

***Discrete Structures***: I have explored mathematical concepts and their applications in computer science, including sets, relations, logic, and combinatorics.

Projects
In addition to my coursework, I have had the opportunity to work on several projects using Python and Java. These projects have allowed me to apply my programming skills and deepen my understanding of various concepts. 

Python: [PROJECTS üë®‚Äçüíª](https://github.com/leorivera17/python)

Description: This project involved developing a web application using Python and Django framework. It incorporated features like user authentication, database management, and interactive user interfaces.

Java: [PROJECTS üñ•Ô∏è](https://github.com/leorivera17/java/tree/main/src)

Description: In this project, I created a Java application that implemented various data structures and algorithms. It focused on optimizing performance and memory utilization for large datasets.
